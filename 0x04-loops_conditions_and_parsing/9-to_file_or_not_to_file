# This script provides information about a file named 'school' by checking its existence, emptiness, and type.

FILE="school"

# 1. Check for existence
if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
  echo "$FILE file exists"

  # If the file exists, perform further checks (nested conditionals)

  # 2. Check if the file is empty
  # -s checks if the file has a size greater than zero (is not empty).
  # So, ! -s means "if not non-empty", which implies it's empty.
  if [ ! -s "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "$FILE file is empty"
  else
    echo "$FILE file is not empty"

  # 3. Check if the file is a regular file
  # -f checks if the file is a regular file (not a directory, symbolic link, etc.).
  if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "$FILE is a regular file"
  # As per requirements, if it's not a regular file (e.g., a directory), do not print anything for this check.
  # So, no 'else' block here.
  fi

else
  # If the file does not exist
  echo "$FILE file does not exist"
